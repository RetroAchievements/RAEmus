This is the history of changes for the win32-specific version of Gens.

January 30, 2005, version 2.12b
-------------------------------

* Fixed a display corruption/flickering bug with DirectX that
  would often occur when switching between windowed and full-screen.

* Fixed a bug in regards to restoring windowed state 
  (minimized/maximized/etc) when switching between windowed and 
  full-screen; sometimes Gens would not switch out of full-screen
  properly.

* New build process for win32 version, using MS VS.NET (VC70) with
  performance optimizations.  Resulting binary is larger, but 
  runtime performance appears better.  Probably runs more smoothly
  on slower machines.

  because i don't recommend you to always use it since this can cause sound bugs with some games.
* Added the possibility to force software blit for Fullscreen "Normal" and "Double" render mode.
  This option can be enabled/disabled only by key-shorcut (see in the shorcuts section) because almost
  people don't need to use it, try it only for speed issue.

- Gens now uses the new MZ80 core of Neil Bradley (v3.4)
  and it corrects some sound bugs !
- Fixed special version auto-detection (Toy Story ...)
- SRAM implemented (Landstaker, Light Crusader ... now work correctly !)
  but not yet saved in a file.

  - Faster than mine !

  but it works better than MZ80 in other cases (animaniacs, contra4 ...).

- Sound is now stopped when clicking on menu or resizing the window ...
- Current directory stored (but not yet in a file, just when you keep gens running)

  implemented but deactivated, it'll be active in the next version !

- Many many fixes in sound and CPU timings:
  - All chips (68000, Z80, YM2612, PSG ...) are synchronized depending on the

    auto-frameskip mode.
  - Fix YM2612 timers.
  - Fix PSG rate.
- Can choose sound sample rate (you must reload the rom for that to take effect !)
- Some little others...

- Fixed the VSRam read and write (vertical scrollings are now okay)

 (Neil Bradley neil@synthcom.com) due to unworking games with MZ80 (I may not use it correctly).
- Some changes in DMA transfers. (sprites of mario (no commercial) rom are okay).
- Full-Screen now works correctly.
  Full-Screen is faster than Windowed mode, just use it !
